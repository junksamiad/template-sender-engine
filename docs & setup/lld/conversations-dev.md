# `conversations-dev` DynamoDB Schema

This document defines the schema for the `conversations-dev` DynamoDB table, which stores conversation state and history for the AI multi-channel communications platform development environment.

## Table Purpose

The `conversations-dev` table serves as the state machine and historical record for each communication initiated through the platform in the development environment. It tracks:
- Individual conversation details and identifiers.
- The current status of the conversation (e.g., processing, sent, failed).
- Message history between the AI/system and the recipient.
- References to external system identifiers (e.g., OpenAI thread IDs).
- Metadata related to processing and configuration.

## Primary Keys

- **Physical Partition Key (PK)**: `primary_channel` (String) - This single attribute stores the primary identifier for the recipient based on the channel.
- **Physical Sort Key (SK)**: `conversation_id` (String) - Unique identifier for the conversation, generated by the Channel Router (e.g., `ci-aaa-001#pi-aaa-001#req123#447123456789`).

**Logical Key Structure (Implemented in Application Code):**
- If `channel_method` is `whatsapp` or `sms`, the `primary_channel` attribute is populated with the value from `recipient_tel`.
- If `channel_method` is `email`, the `primary_channel` attribute is populated with the value from `recipient_email`.

**Primary Channel Derivation Logic:**
The value for `primary_channel` is determined by the application code (specifically within `src_dev/channel-processor/whatsapp/lambda/services/dynamodb_service.py`) before writing the record:
*   If `channel_method` (from the Context Object) is `whatsapp` or `sms`, the value of `recipient_tel` (from the Context Object) is used.
*   If `channel_method` is `email`, the value of `recipient_email` (from the Context Object) is used.
*   The code includes checks to ensure the required identifier (`recipient_tel` or `recipient_email`) exists for the given `channel_method`.

This structure allows:
- A consistent physical key schema for the table definition.
- Efficient lookups of a specific conversation using the primary channel identifier (`primary_channel`) and the `conversation_id`.
- Querying all conversations associated with a specific primary channel identifier (phone number or email address).

## Complex Attribute Structures

### `messages` (List of Maps)
Stores the sequence of interactions within the conversation. Each element in the list is a map.
```json
[
  { // Example AI interaction message entry
    "entry_id": {"S": "uuid-generated-1"},
    "message_timestamp": {"S": "2023-11-01T12:05:00Z"},
    "role": {"S": "assistant"}, // "user" or "assistant"
    "content": {"S": "Hello, this is a message from the AI."},
    "ai_prompt_tokens": {"N": "150"},
    "ai_completion_tokens": {"N": "50"},
    "ai_total_tokens": {"N": "200"},
    "processing_time_ms": {"N": "850"}
  }
  // ... more message maps added chronologically
]
```
- `entry_id`: Unique identifier for this message within the conversation.
- `message_timestamp`: When the message was added/processed.
- `role`: Who sent the message (`user` for incoming/initial prompt, `assistant` for AI response).
- `content`: The text content of the message.
- `ai_*_tokens`: Token counts from OpenAI API interaction.
- `processing_time_ms`: Time taken specifically for this step (e.g., AI call).

### `company_rep` (Map)
See schema definition in `company-data-dev.md`. Copied from the Context Object.

### `ai_config` (Map)
See schema definition in `company-data-db-dev.md`. Copied from the Context Object.

### `channel_config` (Map)
See schema definition in `company-data-db-dev.md`. Copied from the Context Object.

### `project_data` (Map)
Flexible map to store any project-specific key-value pairs passed in the `frontend_payload`.

## Denormalization for Global Secondary Indexes

**Note on `gsi_` Prefixed Attributes:** DynamoDB requires that attributes used as keys (Partition Key or Sort Key) in Global Secondary Indexes (GSIs) must be top-level attributes of scalar type (String, Number, or Binary). They cannot be nested within maps (like `channel_config`) or lists.

To enable efficient querying based on combinations like the company's sending identifier and the recipient's identifier, we introduce denormalized, top-level attributes prefixed with `gsi_` (e.g., `gsi_company_whatsapp_number`, `gsi_recipient_tel`).

- These attributes are populated by the application code (specifically, the channel processor Lambdas when writing the record).
- They contain copies of data found elsewhere in the record (e.g., `recipient_tel` or nested within `channel_config`).
- The code only adds these `gsi_` attributes to an item if the source data actually exists. This creates **sparse indexes**, meaning an item is only included in a specific GSI if it contains the required key attributes for that index. This prevents validation errors when writing items for one channel type (e.g., WhatsApp) that don't naturally have the key data needed for another channel's GSI (e.g., `gsi_company_sms_number`).

## Global Secondary Index (GSI)

The following GSIs are defined to provide alternative query patterns beyond the primary key.

1.  **`company-id-project-id-index`**
    *   **Key Schema**:
        *   Partition Key (PK): `company_id` (String)
        *   Sort Key (SK): `project_id` (String)
    *   **Projection Type**: `ALL` (All attributes are projected from the table to the index).
    *   **Provisioned Throughput**: Uses the table's billing mode (`PAY_PER_REQUEST`).
    *   **Purpose**: Allows querying conversations filtered by `company_id` and `project_id`, useful for company/project-level reporting or dashboards.

2.  **`company-whatsapp-number-recipient-tel-index`**
    *   **Key Schema**:
        *   Partition Key (PK): `gsi_company_whatsapp_number` (String)
        *   Sort Key (SK): `gsi_recipient_tel` (String)
    *   **Projection Type**: `ALL`
    *   **Provisioned Throughput**: Uses the table's billing mode (`PAY_PER_REQUEST`).
    *   **Purpose**: Allows efficiently finding a conversation based on the company's WhatsApp sending number and the recipient's phone number. Primarily used for linking incoming WhatsApp replies.

3.  **`company-sms-number-recipient-tel-index`**
    *   **Key Schema**:
        *   Partition Key (PK): `gsi_company_sms_number` (String)
        *   Sort Key (SK): `gsi_recipient_tel` (String)
    *   **Projection Type**: `ALL`
    *   **Provisioned Throughput**: Uses the table's billing mode (`PAY_PER_REQUEST`).
    *   **Purpose**: Allows efficiently finding a conversation based on the company's SMS sending number and the recipient's phone number. Primarily used for linking incoming SMS replies.

4.  **`company-email-recipient-email-index`**
    *   **Key Schema**:
        *   Partition Key (PK): `gsi_company_email` (String)
        *   Sort Key (SK): `gsi_recipient_email` (String)
    *   **Projection Type**: `ALL`
    *   **Provisioned Throughput**: Uses the table's billing mode (`PAY_PER_REQUEST`).
    *   **Purpose**: Allows efficiently finding a conversation based on the company's email sending address and the recipient's email address. Primarily used for linking incoming email replies.

## Local Secondary Indexes (LSIs)

The following LSIs are defined to support efficient queries within a specific `primary_channel` partition. LSIs must be defined at table creation.

1.  **`created-at-index`**
    *   **Key Schema**:
        *   Partition Key (PK): `primary_channel` (String)
        *   Sort Key (SK): `created_at` (String)
    *   **Projection Type**: `ALL` (Implicitly projects all attributes; queries can fetch any attribute, potentially requiring reads back to the base table if not a key).
    *   **Purpose**: Allows querying conversations for a specific recipient within a date/time range.

2.  **`task-complete-index`**
    *   **Key Schema**:
        *   Partition Key (PK): `primary_channel` (String)
        *   Sort Key (SK): `task_complete` (**Number**) # 0=False, 1=True
    *   **Projection Type**: `ALL`
    *   **Purpose**: Allows efficiently querying conversations for a specific recipient based on whether the initial task is complete (`1`) or not (`0`).
    *   **Note**: The application must map boolean `true` to `1` and `false` to `0` when writing/querying this index key.

3.  **`conversation-status-index`**
    *   **Key Schema**:
        *   Partition Key (PK): `primary_channel` (String)
        *   Sort Key (SK): `conversation_status` (String)
    *   **Projection Type**: `ALL`
    *   **Purpose**: Allows efficiently querying conversations for a specific recipient based on their status (e.g., `processing`, `initial_message_sent`, `failed`).

4.  **`channel-method-index`**
    *   **Key Schema**:
        *   Partition Key (PK): `primary_channel` (String)
        *   Sort Key (SK): `channel_method` (String)
    *   **Projection Type**: `ALL`
    *   **Purpose**: Allows efficiently querying conversations for a specific recipient based on the communication channel used.
