# Handover Notes for Next Agent: AI Multi-Comms Engine

## 1. Project Goal & Context

*   **Objective:** Develop a serverless application on AWS, the "AI Multi-Comms Engine".
*   **Functionality:** Receives communication requests via API Gateway, processes them using Python Lambda functions interacting with OpenAI Assistants, and dispatches messages through various channels (starting with WhatsApp).
*   **Infrastructure:** Defined in `template.yaml` using AWS SAM. It supports distinct `dev` and `prod` environments managed via CloudFormation stacks derived from this single template.
*   **Code Structure:** Lambda source code is primarily within `src_dev/` subdirectories (e.g., `src_dev/channel_router/app/lambda_pkg/`, `src_dev/channel_processor/whatsapp/app/lambda_pkg/`). Note the `lambda_pkg` subdirectory structure implemented recently.
*   **Git:** `develop` branch maps to the `dev` environment; `main` maps to `prod`.

## 2. Key Documents for Context

Please familiarize yourself with the following for a full understanding:

*   `ai-multi-comms-engine-hld.md`: High-Level Design.
*   `template.yaml`: The AWS SAM infrastructure definition (pay attention to `CodeUri` and `Handler` properties for Lambda functions).
*   `python_lambda_imports_setup.md`: Crucial document explaining the solution implemented for Python imports.
*   Files within `src_dev/docs/` & `setup/lld/`: Low-Level Designs.
*   `tests/unit_test_plan.md`: Initial unit test plan (some tests might have evolved).

## 3. Recent Work: Solving Import Conflicts

*   **Challenge:** We faced significant issues with Python imports. Code refactored to use Dependency Injection and relative imports (`from .utils import ...`) passed local `pytest` unit tests but failed deployment on Lambda (`ImportError: attempted relative import with no known parent package`). Conversely, using absolute imports worked on Lambda but broke local tests.
*   **Solution Implemented:** We restructured the Lambda function code within `src_dev` to use a standard Python packaging approach.
    *   Code for each function was moved into a `lambda_pkg` subdirectory (e.g., `src_dev/channel_router/app/lambda_pkg/`).
    *   Code within `lambda_pkg` now consistently uses relative imports (e.g., `from .services import ...`).
    *   `template.yaml` was updated:
        *   `CodeUri` points to the parent `app/` directory (e.g., `src_dev/channel_router/app/`).
        *   `Handler` points to the function within the package (e.g., `lambda_pkg.index.lambda_handler`).
    *   Unit test files (`tests/unit/...`) were updated to import application code using the full path including `lambda_pkg` (e.g., `from src_dev.channel_router.app.lambda_pkg.services import ...`).
*   **Reference:** The `python_lambda_imports_setup.md` file details this setup.

## 4. Current Status

*   The `develop` branch contains the latest refactored code with the working package structure.
*   The full unit test suite (`pytest tests/unit/`) passes successfully on the `develop` branch locally.
*   The code from the `develop` branch has been successfully built and deployed to the AWS `dev` environment (`ai-multi-comms-dev` stack).
*   The deployment was verified using the end-to-end test script (`samples/e2e_test_curl_dev.sh`), which now returns a success status.

## 5. Next Objectives

The immediate next steps involve expanding the testing strategy and automating the workflow:

1.  **Integration Tests:** Develop integration tests that verify the interactions between different components (e.g., API Gateway -> Channel Router -> SQS -> WhatsApp Processor -> DynamoDB). Review any existing plans or documentation within the `tests/` directory.
2.  **End-to-End (E2E) Tests:** Expand on the basic curl test to create more comprehensive E2E tests that potentially validate message delivery (this might require external interaction or simulation). Review any existing plans or documentation within the `tests/` directory.
3.  **CI/CD Pipeline:** Implement a basic CI/CD pipeline (e.g., using GitHub Actions or another service) for the `develop` branch. This pipeline should automatically:
    *   Run unit tests (`pytest tests/unit/`).
    *   Build the SAM application (`sam build --use-container`).
    *   Deploy the application to the `dev` environment (`sam deploy ... --no-confirm-changeset`).
    *   (Optional but recommended) Run integration/E2E tests against the `dev` environment.
